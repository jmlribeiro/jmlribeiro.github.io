General themes:

- Cryptography (in particular, secret sharing, multiparty computation, leakage-resilient cryptography, non-malleable cryptography)

- Coding theory and information theory (in particular, design of efficient codes, sample complexity of statistical reconstruction problems, complexity of computational problems on codes and lattices) 

- Pseudorandomness (in particular, derandomization and randomness extractors)


Some concrete topics (students are welcome to contact me about other possible dissertation topics):

- Trace reconstruction and population recovery from trims and mutations, motivated by connections to computational biology.

- Memory-sample bounds for noisy learning problems over non-binary alphabets.

- Existence of continuously non-malleable codes below 8 states.

- YOSO distributed coin tossing with semi-random corruptions.
