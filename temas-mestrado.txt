General themes:

- Cryptography (in particular, secret sharing, multiparty computation, leakage-resilient cryptography, non-malleable cryptography)

- Coding theory and information theory (in particular, design of efficient codes, sample complexity of statistical reconstruction problems, complexity of computational problems on codes and lattices) 

- Pseudorandomness (in particular, derandomization, randomness extractors, and connections to cryptography)


Some concrete topics (students are welcome to contact me about other possible dissertation topics; see also my personal homepage above):

* Information and coding theory

- Trace reconstruction and population recovery from trims and mutations, motivated by connections to computational biology. https://jmlribeiro.github.io/trace-rec-trim-mutate.txt

- Memory-sample bounds for noisy learning problems over a non-binary alphabet. https://jmlribeiro.github.io/memory-sample-bounds.txt

- Codes against random but correlated errors. https://jmlribeiro.github.io/coding-correlated-errors.txt

- Threshold rates for "list-of-\ell" decoding for random linear codes (with Nicolas Resch). https://jmlribeiro.github.io/list-decoding-rlc.txt


* Cryptography

- Existence of continuously non-malleable codes below 8 states. https://jmlribeiro.github.io/cnmcs.txt

- YOSO distributed coin tossing against semi-random corruptions. https://jmlribeiro.github.io/yoso-semi-random.txt


* Pseudorandomness

- Additive combinatorics and high-error dispersers beyond line-point incidences (with Dean Doron). https://jmlribeiro.github.io/3-2-1.txt
