We know surprisingly little about binary codes that correct a small number of worst-case errors with low redundancy beyond substitutions (where a "0" may be replaced by a "1" and vice-versa) and erasures (where a symbol is erased, being replaced by "?"). The goal of this project is to explore the design of coding schemes in the (extremely concrete) setting where a message is encoded, an adversary applies either a deletion (a symbol is deleted) or an adjacent transposition (two consecutive symbols are swapped) to the encoding, and we must recover the original message from the corrupted codeword. The reason why this simple model is interesting is that it precludes the application of standard techniques for designing codes of this type due to Levenshtein.

The student should be comfortable with (and have a taste for!) combinatorics, and possibly finite fields.
