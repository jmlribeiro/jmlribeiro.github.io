DNA-based data storage systems introduce various types of edit errors (such as deletions, insertions, and substitutions) into stored data in a probabilistic manner. It is, therefore, important to develop coding schemes that allow us to recover encoded data from these corrupted encodings. Research in this direction has mostly focused on models that independently corrupt each stored symbol (for example, each stored symbol is independently deleted with some fixed probability p). However, real-world systems feature correlations between errors. For example, a long run of consecutive occurrences of the same symbol usually experiences more deletions than a smaller run. The goal of this project is to explore codes in these noise models.

The student should be comfortable with (and have a taste for!) discrete probability and combinatorics (and possibly some convex optimization).
